AWS Amplify provides a Git-based CI/CD workflow for building, deploying, and hosting single-page web applications or static sites with serverless backends. Upon connecting to a Git repository, Amplify determines the build settings for both the frontend framework and any serverless backend resources configured with the Amplify CLI, and automatically deploys updates with every code commit.
